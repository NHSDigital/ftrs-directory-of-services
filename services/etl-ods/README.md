# ETL ODS Pipeline


## Installation

This project requires Python and Poetry as core dependencies.
The current versions of these can be found in the `.tool-versions` file, and can be installed using asdf.

### Install Python Dependencies

```bash
make lint # Runs ruff check and ruff format
```

To automatically format Python code and fix some linting issues, you can use:

```bash
eval $(poetry env activate)

ruff check --fix  # Runs linting with fix mode enabled
ruff format       # Runs the python code formatter
```
