  "description": "The Endpoint Business Scenario extension indicates if the endpoint is the main recipient for the message. In most cases, except for Service type 'GP', the entry should be 'Primary'. For Service Type of 'GP' the Primary endpoint will be used to receive messages from dispositions where the patient is being directed to their own GP and the GP needs to have direct access to the call information. The 'Copy' endpoint is only used for Post Event Messaging (PEM) to GP services.",
  "purpose": "The Endpoint Business Scenario extension enables differentiation between primary message recipients and copy recipients, particularly important for GP services where separate endpoints may be required for direct patient dispositions versus Post Event Messaging (PEM) scenarios.",
