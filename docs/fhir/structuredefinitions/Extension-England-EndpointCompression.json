  "description": "The Endpoint Compression extension is used to signify if the message recipient is able to receive compressed data. This will translate to 'Compressed' or 'Uncompressed' respectively. Compression reduces bandwidth requirements and can reduce messaging delays and/or failure.",
  "purpose": "The Endpoint Compression extension enables systems to determine whether an endpoint can accept compressed data, allowing for optimization of data transmission by reducing bandwidth requirements and potential messaging delays or failures.",
