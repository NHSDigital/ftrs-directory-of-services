  title: Directory of Services - Ingest API
  description: |
    ## Overview

    Use this API to submit health and social care service data from your system to the NHS Directory of Services (DoS).

    This API enables data partners to send structured updates on health and social care services: such as service availability, contact details, or referral information; which are validated and prepared for inclusion in the Directory of Services.

    Depending on your access mode, you may create or update:

    - health and social care service data
    - organisation data
    - location data

    The API is designed for secure, system-to-system communication and supports consistent, efficient data submission; helping ensure the DoS remains accurate and up-to-date for use across NHS systems.

    ## Who can use this API

    This API is intended for approved data providers who need to submit or update service information in the NHS Directory of Services (DoS). Typical users may include NHS organisations, local authorities, or trusted third-party systems that manage health and social care service data.

    To use this API, both your organization and the data source must be formally approved through our assurance process. This ensures that only high-quality, trusted data is submitted into the Directory of Services.

    [See Onboarding](#overview--onboarding).

    ## Access modes

    This API has two access modes. They are:
      * [application restricted](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#application-restricted-apis) - addition of new resource allowed / replacement of organization allowed
      * [user restricted](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#user-restricted-apis) - via a UI where healthcare workers authenticate

    ## Roadmap
    At the time of writing (October 2025), we're currently finalising our roadmap and we'll update this content in due course.

    ## Service level

    At the time of writing (October 2025), we're currently finalising our service level and we'll update this content in due course.

    ## Technology

    This API is [RESTful](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/our-api-technologies#basic-rest).

    It conforms to the FHIR UK Core STU3 v0.0.6, based on FHIR R4 v4.0.1.

    You do not need to know much about FHIR to use this API - FHIR APIs are just RESTful APIs that follow specific rules. In particular:
    * resource names are capitalised and singular, for example /Patient not /patients
    * array names are singular, for example line not lines for address lines
    * data items that are country-specific and thus not included in the FHIR global base resources are usually wrapped in an extension object

    There are [libraries and SDKs available](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#fhir-libraries-and-sdks) to help with FHIR API integration.

    ## Network access

    This API is available on the Internet.

    ## Errors

    We use standard HTTP status codes to show whether an API request succeeded or not. They are usually in the range:
    * 200 to 299 if it succeeded, including code 202 if it was accepted by an API that needs to wait for further action
    * 400 to 499 if it failed because of a client error by your application
    * 500 to 599 if it failed because of an error on our server

    Errors specific to each API are shown in the Endpoints section, under Response. See our [reference guide](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#http-status-codes) for more on errors.

    ## Environments and testing

    Links to available environments:

    | Environment | Base URL |
    |-------------|----------|
    | Sandbox | https://sandbox.api.service.nhs.uk/dos-ingest/FHIR/R4 |
    | Integration | https://int.api.service.nhs.uk/dos-ingest/FHIR/R4 |

    ### Sandbox

    Our [sandbox environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#sandbox-testing):
    * is for early developer testing
    * only covers a limited set of scenarios
    * is stateless, so does not actually persist any updates
    * is open access, so does not allow you to test authorisation

    For details of sandbox test scenarios, or to try out the sandbox using our 'Try this API' feature, see the documentation for each endpoint.

    ### Integration

    Our [integration environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#integration-testing):
    * is for formal integration testing
    * is stateful, so can persist updates
    * includes authorisation via API key

    ## Onboarding

    This API is not yet available for onboarding as it's still [in development](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#statuses). You need to get your software approved by us before it can go live with this API, with further information to be added in due course.

      summary: Search for organisations by ODS code to return organization details
      description: |
        ## Overview
        Retrieve an organization identified by an ODS code, or all organizations if no identifier is provided.

        ## Request requirements
        - if the `identifier` query parameter is provided, it must be in the format `odsOrganizationCode|{CODE}` (minimum 5, maximum 12 alphanumeric characters).
        - if the `identifier` parameter is omitted, all organizations will be returned.

        The search is performed using the FHIR-compliant identifier parameter:
        - identifier=odsOrganizationCode|{CODE}

        Example: /Organization?identifier=odsOrganizationCode|ABC123
        Example (all): /Organization
