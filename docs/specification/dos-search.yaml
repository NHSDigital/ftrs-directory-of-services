  title: Directory of Services Search API DOSIS-2192
  description: |
    ## Overview
    Use this API to access healthcare services details profiled in the Directory of Services. This API provides read-only access to the data held in the directory.
    You can:
    - Obtain Organization details (including Endpoints managed by the Organization) for a given Organization ODS Code
    In the future you will be able to:
    - Obtain Organization details (including Endpoints managed by the Organization) for a given service Identifier

    ## Who can use this API
    This API can only be used where you have a valid use case to do so. Please [contact us](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support) before you go too far with your development.
    You must do this before you can go live (see 'Onboarding' below).

    ## Existing API Users
    TBC

    ## Access modes
    This API supports the following access modes:
    - restricted access

    ### Restricted Access
    This is the only access mode supported by the API and it is [application-restricted](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#application-restricted-apis), meaning we authenticate and authorise the calling application but not the end user. This mode is used as part of a back-end process to retrieve healthcare service details
    This access mode adopts the following security/authentication patterns:
    - JWT Private Key authentication

    ## Roadmap

    ## Service Levels
    This is a TBC service. For more details, see [service levels](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#service-levels)

    ## Rate Limits
    TBC

    ## Technology
    This API is [RESTful](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/our-api-technologies#basic-rest)
    It conforms to the FHIR UK Core STU3 v0.0.6, based on FHIR R4 v4.0.1

    You do not need to know much about [FHIR](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/our-api-technologies#fhir) to use this API - FHIR APIs are just RESTful APIs that follow specific rules. In particular:
    - resource names are capitalised and singular, for example /Patient not /patients
    - array names are singular, for example line not lines for address lines
    - data items that are country-specific and thus not included in the FHIR global base resources are usually wrapped in an extension object
    There are [libraries and SDKs available](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#fhir-libraries-and-sdks) to help with FHIR API integration.

    ## Network access
    This API is available over the internet

    ## Errors
    We use standard HTTP status codes to show whether an API request succeeded or not. They are usually in the range:
    - 200 to 299 if it succeeded, including code 202 if it was accepted by an API that needs to wait for further action
    - 400 to 499 if it failed because of a client error by your application
    - 500 to 599 if it failed because of an error on our server
    Errors specific to each API endpoint are shown in the Endpoints section, under Response. See our [reference guide](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#http-status-codes) for more on errors.
    Your API-calling application should have a mechanism to automatically try again, for example by giving status information to your end user, before giving up. See our [reference guide](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#error-handling) for more information about error handling.

    ### Sandbox testing
    Our [sandbox environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#sandbox-testing) is for early developer testing only covers a limited set of scenarios is open access, so does not allow you to test authorisation.
    ### Integration testing
    Our [integration test environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#integration-testing) is for formal integration testing includes authorisation via JWT Private Key.
    ## Onboarding
    You must get your software onboarded before it can go live. For more details, contact us at TBC.
