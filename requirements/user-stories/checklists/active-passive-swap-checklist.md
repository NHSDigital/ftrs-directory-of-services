- Approval: Scheduled window & change approval recorded
- Automation: Run book exists; swap initiated via automated steps
- Monitoring: Pre/post cutover SLOs compared; error rate delta ≤5%
- Drift detection: Configuration/state comparisons executed; discrepancies logged
- Rollback: Fallback procedure defined and tested if degradation detected
- Evidence: Swap logs, monitoring screenshots, drift report stored
- Remediation: Tickets created for findings; actions tracked
- Communication: Stakeholders notified of cutover start/completion
- Frequency: Swap executed at agreed cadence (e.g., quarterly)
